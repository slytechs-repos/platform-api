/**
 * Provides high-precision timing utilities for managing delays and time-based
 * operations at nanosecond resolution. This class combines both blocking and
 * spinning delay mechanisms to achieve more accurate timing control than
 * traditional sleep operations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class implements a hybrid delay strategy where longer delays use blocking
 * operations for efficiency, while shorter delays use CPU spinning for
 * precision. This approach helps minimize both CPU usage and timing
 * inaccuracies.

 * Note that actual timing precision may vary based on system capabilities, CPU
