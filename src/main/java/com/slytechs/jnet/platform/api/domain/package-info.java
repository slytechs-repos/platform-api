/**
 * Provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and managing
 * domain-specific contexts, configurations, and functionalities within a
 * hierarchical structure.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The central concept of this package revolves around <b>domains</b>, which
 * represent modular units of functionality and data encapsulation. These
 * domains are organized in a hierarchy, similar to a filesystem, allowing
 * seamless interaction and composition of domain-specific features.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Key components of the package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Domain:</b> Represents a specific functional module or context. Each
 * domain encapsulates its own state, functionality, and data, and can be linked
 * within the domain hierarchy to provide cross-domain accessibility.</li>
 * <li><b>DomainFolder:</b> A container for grouping related domains. It
 * facilitates hierarchical organization and traversal of the domain structure.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>DomainPath:</b> Represents the navigable path to a domain within the
 * hierarchy. It allows programmatic access to specific domains or resources.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Value:</b> A generic representation of data or attributes associated
 * with a domain. This abstraction enables type-safe access and modification of
 * domain-specific data.</li>
 * <li><b>ValueDomain:</b> A specialized domain for managing and accessing
 * domain-specific values, facilitating the organization and retrieval of
 * metadata and configurations.</li>
 * <li><b>ValueFolder:</b> Extends the concept of <code>DomainFolder</code> to
 * organize and manage collections of values, supporting operations like
 * addition, removal, and lookup of values.</li>
 * <li><b>DomainService:</b> A Service Provider Interface (SPI) for dynamically
 * integrating domain-specific functionalities. Modules can use this interface
 * to export their domains and provide runtime extensibility.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Usage and Applications</h2>
 * <p>
 * This package is particularly suited for building modular and extensible
 * systems where different functional components need to interact in a
 * structured and hierarchical manner. Examples include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Protocol stacks that provide domains for packets, headers, and fields,
 * allowing advanced protocol analysis and metadata extraction.</li>
 * <li>Configuration pipelines that organize and expose their contexts, states,
 * and settings through domain hierarchies.</li>
 * <li>Applications that require a global hierarchical context to access,
 * manage, and format diverse types of data.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Integration with SPI</h2>
 * <p>
 * The <code>DomainService</code> interface facilitates integration and runtime
 * extension by enabling modules to provide their domain implementations through
 * the Java Service Loader mechanism. This allows seamless composition and
 * aggregation of domain functionalities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Extensibility</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package is designed with extensibility in mind, providing clear
 * abstractions and interfaces that can be extended to cater to specific
 * requirements, making it ideal for dynamic and evolving projects.
